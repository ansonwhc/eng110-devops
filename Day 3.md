# Environment variable
It's a placeholder for data, such that we don't have to repeat defining or specifying our data.  

Environment command | Functions | Note | Eg
--- | --- | --- | ---
`printenv [KEY]`  | check existing `env var`| all default env var can be init when boot | `printenv HOME`
`export [KEY]=[VALUE]` | create an `env var` | all set values would be inputted as str | `export NAME=anson`
 | make an env var persistent on linux ubuntu
