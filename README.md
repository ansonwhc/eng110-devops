# DevOps
## What is DevOps?  
It is a way of work, a cross-function team, combining the developers team
and the operations team. This highly collaborated DevOps team shares
responsibilities, delivers the infrastructure as code, and automates the
production pipeline throughout. And to be a successful DevOps team, they also have to follow good engineering practices of continouos integration, delivery and deployment.
