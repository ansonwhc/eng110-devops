# DevOps
## What is DevOps?  
It is a way of work, a cross-function team, combining the developers team
and the operations team. This highly collaborated DevOps team shares
responsibilities, delivers the infrastructure as code, and automates the
production pipeline throughout. And to be a successful DevOps team, they also have to follow good engineering practices of continouos integration, delivery and deployment.

### DevOps four key pillars
- Ease of use
    - The emphasis on automation allows the DevOps team to focus on serving higher quality product.
- Flexibility
    - Adaptivity is key to DevOps, the ability to follow the market trend on new technologies, utilise them, and replace outdated practices.
- Robustness
    - The interconnection between developers and the operation team create a more effective workflow, combined with good engineering practices, automation, iterative approach to design.
- Cost effective
    - Reduced miscommunication and faster delivery minimises operational cost and increases product quality, which generates a higher return in the long run.

## Why DevOps?  
The DevOps team is skilled in and responsible for all aspects of the software development life cycle. It allows for higher quality products by minimising the software implementation issues and increasing the speed and frequency of delivery. 

### DevOps Benefits
- Greater collaboration
    - With the developers and the operation team merging, it encourages teamwork and more communication.
- Higher software quality & Reliability
    - DevOps team has more information faster about more aspects of the software in all development lifecycle stages. The better understanding allows for more reliable and higher quality product.
- Shorter development cycle & Efficiency
    - The combined team is working closer together, minimising turnover time and miscommunication 
- Faster delivery & more frequent updates
    - With borken silos and faster turnover time, developers are able to patch and provide updates more frequently. It results in higher customer satisfaction.
